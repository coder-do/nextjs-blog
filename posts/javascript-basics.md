Add this code to the *main.js* file

```js
const myHeading = document.querySelector('h1');
myHeading.textContent = 'Hello world!';
```

## Example

Assign values to variables and add them together:

```js
var x = 5;         // assign the value 5 to x
var y = 2;         // assign the value 2 to y
var z = x + y;     // assign the value 7 to z (5 + 2)
```
